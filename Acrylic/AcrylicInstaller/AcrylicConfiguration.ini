;
; THE ACRYLIC DNS CACHING MECHANISM EXPLAINED
;
; When Acrylic receives a DNS request from a client the hosts cache (a static
; cache contained in the AcrylicHosts.txt file) is searched first. If nothing
; is found in it the request is subsequently searched in the address cache (a
; dynamic cache contained in the AcrylicCache.dat file). At this point three
; things may happen:
;
; Case 1:
;
; The request is not found in the address cache or its corresponding response
; is older than AddressCacheScavengingTime minutes: In this case the original
; request is forwarded to all of the configured DNS servers simultaneously. The
; response to the client is delayed until the first one of the configured DNS
; servers comes out with a response (all the others will be discarded).
;
; Case 2:
;
; The request is found in the address cache and its corresponding response is
; older than AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime minutes but not older than
; AddressCacheScavengingTime minutes: In this case the response to the client
; is sent immediately from the address cache and the original request is also
; forwarded to all of the configured DNS servers like in the previous case. The
; first response coming from one of the configured DNS servers will be used to
; silently update the address cache (all the others will be discarded).
;
; Case 3:
;
; The request is found in the address cache and its corresponding response is
; younger than AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime minutes: In this case the response
; to the client is sent immediately from the address cache and no network
; activity with the configured DNS servers will occur.
;
; Note: Negative responses from the DNS servers can be cached with a different
; expiration time (usually much smaller) than positive ones by setting the value
; of the AddressCacheNegativeTime parameter.
;
; Simply using Acrylic with default parameters should give a lot of boost to the
; performance of your DNS queries but to get the best out of it you may have to
; tune it to your specific needs:
;
; If you are concerned with the cache not being enough up to date (e.g. you are
; using Acrylic on a LAN with addresses given by a DHCP server using a short
; lease) use a lower value for the AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime and the
; AddressCacheNegativeTime parameters. For example:
;
; AddressCacheNegativeTime=30
; AddressCacheScavengingTime=28800
; AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=30
;
; If your DNS servers are particularly unreliable and you want to minimize the
; disruption to your work should they become unresponsive use a higher value for
; the AddressCacheScavengingTime and the AddressCacheNegativeTime. For example:
;
; AddressCacheNegativeTime=57600
; AddressCacheScavengingTime=57600
; AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=30
;
; If you are concerned about network bandwidth and you don't care having a cache
; less up to date use a higher value for all the parameters. For example:
;
; AddressCacheNegativeTime=57600
; AddressCacheScavengingTime=57600
; AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=2147483647
;
; And now about the caching parameters:
;
; The time to live (in minutes) of a negative response in the address cache.
;
AddressCacheNegativeTime=57600
;
; The time to live (in minutes) of a positive response in the address cache.
;
AddressCacheScavengingTime=57600
;
; The time (in minutes) elapsed which an item in the address cache must be
; silently updated should a request occur.
;
AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=2147483647
;
; AddressCache data can be compressed by Acrylic should it determine (on a
; single item basis) that it would save some space. Since a very fast LZO
; compression engine is used it is usually best to keep compression ON.
;
; AddressCacheDisableCompression=Yes
;
; The local IP address to which Acrylic binds. A value of 0.0.0.0 indicates
; that Acrylic should bind to all available addresses and as such it will be
; able to receive DNS requests and responses coming from all of your network
; cards and modems. A value corresponding to the IP address of one of them
; instead will allow Acrylic to receive DNS requests/responses only from
; that specific network card or modem.
;
LocalBindingAddress=0.0.0.0
;
; The UDP port at which Acrylic responds. The default value of 53 is the
; standard port for DNS resolution. You should change this value only if
; you are using a non standard DNS client.
;
LocalBindingPort=53
;
; The file name of the hit log into which every incoming DNS packet seen by
; Acrylic gets logged. You can specify here an absolute or a relative path and
; a sort of daily log rotation can be achieved by including the %DATE% template
; within the name.
;
; In the hit log, along with the packet timestamp, client address and host name
; there's a treatment field (how Acrylic treated it). Possibile values are:
;
; B -> Explicitly blocked
; H -> Resolved from the HOSTS cache
; C -> Resolved from the Acrylic cache
; F -> Forwarded to the configured DNS servers
; R -> Received from one of the configured DNS servers
; U -> Silent update from one of the configured DNS servers
;
; Example:
;
; HitLogFileName=HitLog.%DATE%.txt
;
HitLogFileName=
;
; The filter which controls what gets logged into the hit log and what's not.
; A valid filter is whatever combination of packet types (for their meaning
; see the previous note) specified in any order.
;
HitLogFileWhat=BHCFRU
;
; The file name of the stats log into which Acrylic saves informations
; about the performance of your DNS servers and some statistical data about
; the fate of your DNS requests. You can specify here an absolute or a relative
; path.
;
StatsLogFileName=
;
; ALLOWING REQUESTS FROM OTHER COMPUTERS
;
; Although for security reasons the default behaviour of Acrylic is to refuse
; to handle requests coming from other computers it is possible to specify in
; the AllowedAddressesSection a list of IP addresses (and also partial IP
; addresses useful for representing entire A-B-C class subnets) from which
; can come requests that Acrylic is allowed to handle. You have to specify
; a different key name for each complete or partial IP address allowed, like
; in the following example:
;
; [AllowedAddressesSection]
; IP1=192.168.45.254        -- A single IP address
; IP2=192.168.44.100        -- Another single IP address
; IP3=192.168.100.          -- All addresses starting with 192.168.100.
; IP4=172.16.               -- All addresses starting with 172.16.
;
; For performance reasons keep the number of addresses listed in this section
; as low as possible (you can try to specify subnets instead of large lists of
; IP addresses whenever possible).
;
[AllowedAddressesSection]
;
; The CacheExceptionsSection section may contain a list of names
; for which caching does not occur (DNS requests for them are directly
; forwarded to the DNS servers). This may be useful if you have a small
; subset of IP addresses that change rapidly but you don't want to loose
; the performance improvements of caching for all the other addresses.
;
; Example:
;
; [CacheExceptionsSection]
; NAME1=somemachine.mydomain.local
; NAME2=www.microsoft.com
;
[CacheExceptionsSection]
;
; The WhiteExceptionsSection section may contain a list of names
; outside of which DNS requests are resolved by Acrylic as "localhost". If
; the section is empty Acrylic behaves normally by trying to resolve every DNS
; request through all its strategies (hosts cache, address cache, forward). If
; the section contains at least an item instead Acrylic behaves as in some
; sort of parental control mode by resolving automatically as "localhost"
; every DNS request for hosts which are not present in the list.
;
; Example:
;
; [WhiteExceptionsSection]
; NAME1=mayakron.altervista.org
; NAME2=en.wikipedia.org
; NAME3=disney.go.com
;
